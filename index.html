    Cypress and Playwright comparison
  </h1>
  <hr />
  <div id="my-doc">
    <p>
    <h3>Cypress:</h3> <br />
    ➕ Easy to understand documentation <br />
    ➕ A broader community and easier to find answers about specific issues<br />
    ➕ Easier to understand for people new to testing<br />
    ➕ You only have to read up on one framework as Cypress has everything included.<br />
    ➖ Doesn’t support multi-page and third-party implementations.<br />
    ➖ More extensive and with more dependencies<br />
    ➖ Generates several example files and folders<br />
    ➖ You have to re-run tests to run in another browser.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Playwright:</h3> <br />
    ➕ Broader browser support <br />
    ➕ Fewer dependencies than Cypress <br />
    ➕ Supports multi-page and third-party implementations <br />
    ➕ Lets you choose your test runner. <br />
    ➕ Doesn’t generate any files. <br />
    ➕ You can run multiple browsers using the same test. <br />
    ➖ Documentation not as good <br />
    ➖ Newer and with a smaller community <br />

      <h3>What to pick?</h3>
      The answer is it depends on what functionality you find essential. If you’re new to testing and want a more plug-and-play approach that
      includes everything you need to get started, then Cypress is the best choice for you. It has good documentation
      and
      a broader community that makes it easier to get help and find answers to specific scenarios you find challenging.
      <br>If you are more familiar with testing, need to test Webkit browsers or your tests need to cover scenarios
      spanning
      across multiple pages and domains, then Playwright is the choice for you. Playwright is also the right choice for
      you if you have fallen in love with a specific test runner or don’t need one at all. With the framework being
      reasonably new, we can also expect that the community, documentation and framework in general will continue to
      improve over time.
